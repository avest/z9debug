Goals:

Keep debug focused on debug only.

Keep debug 100% stand alone.

Keep debug as small, simple, and fast as possible.

TODO:
Add support for mult classes in a single php file.
Eliminate need for .htaccess and mod_rewrite... (done 2018-10-24)
Change session data file extension from .txt to .php. (done 2018-10-24)
Add php exit() at start of data files. (done 2018-10-24)
Require strong password to login. (done 2018-10-24)
Add visual divide between loop variables. (done 2018-10-24)
Require remote_authentication url use HTTPS. (done 2018-10-24)

Possible Enhancements:
Block failed login ips.
Enable emailing of failed logins.
Log all/failed logins.
Auto redirect to HTTPS page. If not a HTTPS page, do not process the login.
Require valid SSL cert.
Limit login to certain ip addresses.

Note: related to security...
Don't make your dev sites publicly known.
When possible, don't ename debug in production if not needed.
Install in a folder that isn't named "debug" or "z9debug".

On the file list, show a count for the number of times each function was called. (based on the debug::on() statement getting called)

Show function/method calls in var output automatically. Treat the calls like a debug::variable() statement. Only so many loop calls allowed.
We could then see the var, str, and func calls in one feed. (would need to add a new debug line type for output.)

Ability to load empty debug class in production for max speed and security. (use debug_noop.php)

Create video example of using debug.

Create a load process for popular frameworks.

Have debug add all debug::variable() statements automatically. (and remove statements automatically)
