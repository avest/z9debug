Goals:

Keep debug focused on debug only.

Keep debug 100% stand alone.

Keep debug as small, simple, and fast as possible.

Possible Future Features:

Increase security.
Limit login to certain ip addresses.
Block failed login ips.
Enable emailing of failed logins.
Log all/failed logins.
Require strong password to login.
Require HTTPS. Auto redirect to HTTPS page. If not a HTTPS page, do not process the login.
Require valid SSL cert.
Insure that the session folder files and config files are not accessible in the browser.

Note: related to security...
Don't make your dev sites publicly known.
Only enable debug on dev for added security.
Install in a folder that isn't named "debug" or "z9debug".

On the file list, show a count for the number of times each function was called. (based on the debug::on() statement getting called)

Show function/method calls in var output automatically. Treat the calls like a debug::variable() statement. Only so many loop calls allowed.
We could then see the var, str, and func calls in one feed. (would need to add a new debug line type for output.)

Ability to load empty debug class in production for max speed and security. (use debug_noop.php)

Create video example of using debug.

Create a load process for popular frameworks.

Have debug add all debug::variable() statements automatically. (and remove statements automatically)
